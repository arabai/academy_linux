# Dataminded Academy - Introduction to Linux & Bash
## Exercise 1 - Files manipulation & globbing

In this exercise you will have to use the Linux files manipulation commands (and globbing patterns). The tasks are the following:

1. Generate the exercise by running `./generate_exercise.sh`. This will create you two folders: landing_area and structured_area
2. Sort the landing_area files inside the structured folders in structured_area in the least amount of commands possible. To do so, help yourself with globbing.
3. Keep the commands you used in step 2 and put them all in a script that automate the processing of the landing_area. Try your script on a regenerated environment.

If you need to restart your exercise, you can run the `./cleanup.sh` script followed by the `./generate_exercise.sh` script again.
